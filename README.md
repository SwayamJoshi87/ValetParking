# ValetParking
A valet parking system designed using the AGILE workflow.

## Vehicles
This system can accomodate motorcycles, cars and bikes and can even be paused, pre-closed 
and it even generates an end of the day and tows any vehicle that is not claimed until the end of the day

## Interface
Currently, the program is terminal based. However, in future I am plannig to implement a fully functional GUI.

## Data and storage
The program stores data in a plain text file and loads the data into classes in C++ and the performs the operations
and then rewrites the data back to files. Each time making a backup of the previous file if necessary.
